# PPMS_DATA_Analysis_Matlab
This project is used to analyse PPMS data in batch processing.
The function of “RT_ST.m” is to plot R-T curve and separate R-B data into different tables according to measured temperature. 
After running “RT_ST.m”, some new tables named as temperature will appear in the folder. 
Copy and paste “Rxx_B.m”, “Rxy_B.m” and those new “.xlsx” files in one empty folder. 
Input your measuring parameters as the program requested. Then run “Rxx_B.m”, and “Rxy_B.m”, the figures of Rxx_B and Rxy_B at different temperature can be plotted successfully.
